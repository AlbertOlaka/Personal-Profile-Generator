# Personal-Profile-Generator
# What I'm I aiming to achieve and learn:
    - Data Types
    - Variables
    - User Inputs
    - String Formatting
    - Basic Arithmetic
# What I'm Building:
I'm building a console pprogram that:
    - Asks for name
    - Asks for age
    - Asks for height
    - Asks for whether the user is a student (true/false)
    - Prints a formatted summary
# How I'm I going to build it:
1. Create a new Java file
2. Create my main method
3. What data types do I need?
    - Name?
    - Age?
    - Height?
    - Student status
4. Declare Variables
5. Research how to get user input in Java
6. Store the input into variables 
7. Perform a calculation
8. Print everything in a clean formatted sentence.

# What I learned from this.
1. Different types of data types and how to use them.
2. How to get user inputs using scanner in java.
3. Touched on while loop and used it in the code.
4. How to print out the results after getting the inputs.
5. How to store user inputs into variables.
